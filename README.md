# FluidCSS v0.6

Welcome to FluidCSS v0.7! This is a complete rewrite and overhaul. Some key changes are underlined below:

- New Build System
  > FluidCSS is now written in Sass! [More specifically SCSS]
  (This was mainly due to maintainability issues while writing a big library in vanilla CSS.)
- We now have a Responsive Grid system!
- Added a better button ripple animation [as seen in Material Design]
