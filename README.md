 ### Contribution Guidelines
 - Start by forking this repo
 - Check the [Project Roadmap](https://github.com/nikhilmwarrier/fluidcss/blob/main/README.md#project-roadmap) for features that have to be implemented
 - If you want to add a new feature, create a separate stylesheet with only the feature you want and save it as `feature-name.css` instead of adding it to the main `fluid.css`. If your PR is accepted, it will be merged with the main stylesheet. This makes it easy to manage the project.
 - Only make changes that are absolutely required in the main stylesheet, and explain those _clearly_.
 - Ensure browser support from atleast MS Edge 16 or above.
 - **Submit a working [Codepen sample](http://codepen.io) for the features or fixes highlighted in your PR, not just a screenshot**
 - Make sure your PR is descriptive, but don't make it longer than four paragraphs.
 - Make sure the changes you add can be understood by even a beginner.
 - Make full use of existing CSS custom properties.
 - Last but not the least, **compare your PR with the latest commit in the actual FluidCSS repo and make additional changes (if required) before actually submitting the PR.**
 
We are looking forward to your contributions!
