# FluidCSS v0.6

Welcome to FluidCSS v0.6. This is a major rewrite and overhaul. Some key changes are underlined below:

- New Build System
  > FluidCSS is now written in Sass! [More specifically SCSS]
  > This was mainly due to maintainability issues while writing a big library in vanilla CSS.
